          The Auto-Rebase label [![label: autorebase:opt-in][~autorebase:opt-in]](https://github.com/alfieyfc/trevor-slattery/labels/autorebase%3Aopt-in) isn't added. This is most likely due to a known [issue](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/135) of the action [labeler](https://github.com/actions/labeler).

          *_Please manually label this PR for automatic rebase if that suits your purpose._*
